## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

In addition to learning how to utilize functions to determine the card sizes, I also learnt how to use a hover effect to alter the color or other internal features of the same card.

### Continued development

Keep practicing, as I only know the basics, but I've never worked on significant projects when it comes to frontend design.
